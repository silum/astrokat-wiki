Specifying terminology and functionality that is incorporated into the new observation framework in relation to observational requirements.

## All observations
* Type of input coordinates   
Details on page [Observation target specification](https://github.com/ska-sa/astrokat/wiki/Observation-target-specification) -- needs to be updated with using only template obs_plan files and all target definitions and when

* types of calibrators and where to find them   
Details on page [MeerKAT calibrator selection](https://github.com/ska-sa/astrokat/wiki/MeerKAT-calibrator-selection) -- needs to be updated with new implementations as well as with details for OPT GUI

* verification needs -- the various steps and stages of running the script offline and online

### Noise diode usage during observations
* astrokat [issue 5](https://github.com/ska-sa/astrokat/issues/5)
