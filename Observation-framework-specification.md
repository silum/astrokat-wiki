Specifying tags and functionality to incorporate into the new observation framework in relation to observational requirements.

## All observations
* Type of input coordinates
* types of calibrators and where to find them

* verification needs -- the various steps and stages of running the script offline and online

### Noise diode usage during observations
* astrokat [issue 5](https://github.com/ska-sa/astrokat/issues/5)




## Correlator specific observational requirements
Information and options required during observation planning and execution in the YAML file
